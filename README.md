# react-startkit

A friendly React startkit allows you to start working on React with all dependencies installed. Dependencies include: React, Babel, Webpack, Hot-Loder, ES6.

url:

    localhost:3000

start:

    node dev-server.js

issue with webpack hot-loders now, debugging.....

Meanwhile, I recommend <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> if you want to play with React. Definitely one of the best starterkits out there, and it was built by Dan Abramov.
